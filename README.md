> CS3245 Information Retrieval Assignment Collaboration

A search engine that indexes and implements search functions for retrieving patent XML documents.

Our search engine utilizes the patent's title, description and IPC codes to perform zonal searching of relevant documents. Pre-processing is done by removing stop words and stemming (using Porter's Stemmer). Query expansion is achieved by using a vocabulary of synonyms.
